# SerilogSinks

This repository showcases how to utilize Serilog, a versatile logging library for .NET, along with different sinks to handle log events efficiently. Serilog provides a flexible logging framework that allows developers to log events to various destinations, known as sinks, such as files, databases, consoles, and more.

## Getting Started
To get started with using Serilog and exploring its functionality with different sinks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https:https://github.com/AnthonyPWatts/SerilogSinks.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd SerilogSinks
```

3. Open the Solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

4. Explore the Examples:
Browse through the code samples in the project to understand how Serilog is configured and used with various sinks.

## Features
* Serilog Configuration: Learn how to configure Serilog to log events with different sinks.
* File Sink: Demonstrates logging to a file using Serilog.
* Console Sink: Shows logging to the console for debugging purposes.
* Seq Sink: Illustrates logging to Seq, a centralized log server, for structured logging and analysis.
* And More: Explore additional sinks supported by Serilog and how to integrate them into your applications.

## Usage
Each example in the repository comes with detailed comments and explanations to help you understand how to use Serilog effectively with different sinks. Feel free to experiment with the code and adapt it to your specific logging requirements.
